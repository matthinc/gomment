* gomment - A simple comment microservice using Go and Docker
[[https://api.travis-ci.com/matthinc/gomment.svg?branch=master]]
[[https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/matthinc/gomment.svg]]

** Why gomment?
- *Lighweight* - The docker image is < 30MB, the JavaScript file is < 20kB (gzip < 5kB)
- *Fast* - Native performance thanks to go
- *Frontend-agnostic* - Use the default JavaScript frontend or build your own using the *gomment JSON API*
- *Container-first* - gomment was built with *Docker* in mind from the first second
- *Portable* - gomment uses a single SQLite file as its database

** TODO Demo

** Contributing
All contributions to the project are welcome. Make sure to read the project philosophy before submitting your contribution.

*** Project Philosophy
- Store the data read-optimized - Sacrifice performance when inserting comments
- Not everything is a ressource - We use a simple JSON HTTP API, not REST
- JavaScript: Keep it vanilla - No JavaScript build pipeline, just static analyzers
- The 3rd NF can be violated - Traversing trees in DBMS is expensive, keep it fast
- System tests > unit test coverage - Users care /that/ it works, not /how/ it works

*** Conventions and Standards
- CSS identifier naming: [[http://getbem.com/naming/][BEM]]
- JS type checking: Typescript

** Embedding

 }).injectInto('#comments');
</script>
